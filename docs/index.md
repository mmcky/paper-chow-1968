# The Acceleration Principle and the Nature of Business Cycles

A MyST Markdown reproduction of Gregory C. Chow's 1968 paper from
*The Quarterly Journal of Economics*.

## Overview

This project provides a web-readable version of:

> Chow, G. C. (1968). The Acceleration Principle and the Nature of Business Cycles.
> *The Quarterly Journal of Economics*, 82(3), 403–418.

The paper presents a formulation of the acceleration principle with strong
econometric evidence, and analyzes whether the acceleration principle is
necessary for generating oscillations in national output. The discussion
extends from the nonstochastic case to the stochastic case using
autocovariances and spectral densities.

## Key Contributions

1. **Formulation of the acceleration principle** derived from stock adjustment
   equations, with empirical evidence from U.S. macroeconomic data.

2. **Nonstochastic result**: Without acceleration, a system of demand equations
   obeying simple distributed lags cannot produce prolonged oscillations
   (all characteristic roots are real and positive).

3. **Stochastic generalization**: Random shocks can generate cycles even in
   systems without complex roots, meaning the acceleration principle is no
   longer *necessary* for oscillations.

4. **Spectral analysis**: Complex roots are neither necessary nor sufficient
   for generating distinct cycles in the spectral density sense, though in the
   Hansen–Samuelson model they are necessary.
